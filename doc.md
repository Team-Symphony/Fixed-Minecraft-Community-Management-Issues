# Jab and Issues with the Management of Fixed Minecraft

For several reasons, primarily related to green_jab's actions and opinions, many members of staff and contributors to the project have decided to leave Fixed Minecraft and fork it, creating our own project. A list of members who are participating in this fork is provided below.

As a community, we aim to be as inclusive as we can, and sometimes this requires excluding some people who are not being welcoming to others.  
Many of the people in this community are themselves trans or queer, and we will not tolerate any hate towards those who are.

The future home of the forked project is located at [Team-Symphony](https://github.com/Team-Symphony) on GitHub.  
The discord server for the project can also be joined here: [__https://dsc.gg/symphony-mc__](https://dsc.gg/symphony-mc)

::: info
We **DO NOT** have any issue with those who are religious or hold religious beliefs. It only becomes an issue when you attempt to force said religious beliefs onto everyone else and use the religious beliefs to justify hate.

## TL;DR

- Jab has a history of bad actions
  - Transphobia/Queerphobia
  - Some other concerning things
- Jab is currently mismanaging the project 
  - Combative and difficult to work with, not open to suggestions
  - Not properly moderating transphobia and queerphobia in the discord server, as well as promoting it himself.
  - Ego getting in the way of the project

Because of this, we are going to be forking Fixed Minecraft and will be producing our own mod.

## To Jab

Although this may seem like an attack on you personally, that is not our goal. If you're willing to improve and change, we are more than happy to bring you back into our community. We are not looking to vilify you or make you out to be a bad person.  
However, currently, we do not feel that you are fit to lead our community or to be a figurehead of our community.

## Transphobia, Homophobia, and General Queerphobia

There are currently persistent issues of transphobia and general queerphobia. The Minecraft community is an extremely inclusive community, and this is not something that we will tolerate, especially as many of the members of the team working on Fixed Minecraft are themselves trans or queer.

### WaveTech

During pride month of 2024, Jab posted several incredibly insensitive, transphobic, and generally queerphobic messages in the WaveTech discord server. WaveTech is a discord server centered around technical Minecraft.  
For some of the messages, we cannot get screenshots or links to them, as they were deleted. However, we can provide a transcription of some of them.

We don't have some of the messages from what originally happened in the WaveTech server, however according to our research as well as contact with several people who were there at the time, this is what happened:

- During June of 2024, WaveTech, as many discord servers do, changed its server icon to include a pride flag.
- In response to this, Jab posted a message in a private members-only chat in WaveTech server, Jab posted a message complaining about the icon change, as well as just some general queerphobia.
- In response to this, the WaveTech staff team did not appropriately moderate the situation, causing at least one member of the WaveTech server to leave.
- Jab then also left the WaveTech server. Jab did later come back to post an ""apology"", before leaving again.

Although we do not have the original message sent in WaveTech, we do have some of the later messages, so it can give you an idea of the contents of the original message.

> Like many things in this world, just because something appears to be a simple question, doesn’t mean it has a simple, black or white answer. When given the prompt: “do you support LGBTIQA+?” If I answer yes, then that would imply that I must also support Irreversible cosmetic surgery for children who are still not even aloud to drink or get tattoos, PRIDE parades and pre-school drag shows with their push of sexualised nudity onto minors who are yet to even learn what sex is. That I must be in support of MAPS (Minor attracted people) which is just another name for paedophiles, males entering dedicated female safe spaces like bathrooms and prisons, with nothing more than a wig, Workplace diversity quotas who hire based on who they have sex with, not necessarily their professional skills, and the control of language like calling people ‘birthing person’, which is incredibly offensive to biological women. However, I also can’t just say no, as that would imply that I straight up hate everyone who doesn’t fit into the heteronormative of male or female, feel they are “less than human” and deserve no rights, creating unsafe places for them being overall a huge dick and an intolerable bigot. The answer lies somewhere in the middle, in the grey. (edited)

> I love the people, I accept them for who they are, as I see they have been created in the image of God, and therefore have incredible intrinsic worth that no one can take away from them, and I see that God loves them more than they love themselves, who am I to go against God and not love them also, I see them as so much more than what their sexual orientation and gender identity happen to be. I don’t care what pronouns you use, that’s not me saying I don’t think they are important, that is me saying I will treat you like an equal regardless of what you call yourself, which is what the goal of the pride movement started off as, equality. I however now disagree with where the overall pride movement has become, how it is on the side of everything I listed above and more, how it has seeped its way into every part of life, from the media and ads we see online, the lessons we take in school and university, quotas at work, the policies against free speech and just about everywhere else. It has basically become a sort of religion of its own, and it has overstepped its boundaries.

> How is it possible to love the people yet not the movement? Look at me, I call myself a Christian, but that does not mean I align myself to every action that has been committed in the name of Christianity, and quite frankly, don’t necessarily agree with a lot of what the larger Christian community does. I hate how the church overall has treated people they consider ‘different’ to themselves and don’t treat people with the love and respect they deserve. Likewise, I know many people who are LGBT who do not agree with everything the larger community does. How they believe this has all gone too far and hide who they really are, in fear not from those who are not a part of the community, but from those who are.
>
> Wavetech is a Technical Minecraft server at its core, so what should matter the most is that we all agree to have fun playing this game at a high level together. It is not a quote unquote ‘Christian Minecraft Server’. Where you have to be christian, can not swear and everything that comes with it, however nor is it an “Pride Minecraft server” where everyone has to be part of the LGBT community and anyone who disagrees in the slightest is kicked out. I have not hidden that I am a Christian, and others have not hidden how much they don’t care, from disagreeing to outright hating that part of me, and yet we have still gotten along overly peacefully, despite how much they might have just ignored, disagreed or hated a fundamental part of my identity, trying to make it not a safe place for me, as I continue to love them and forgive them. I would have thought that it should have also gone the other way, where even if I don’t align my beliefs 100% with everyone else's when it comes to pride, we could still look past the differences and continue to play minecraft together.

> I have been a member of wavetech for almost 3 and a half years, and I have been active on the discord basically daily for the last 2. My being here had never been a problem up until this point, as I am not against anyone here, and usually try to go out of my way to make sure things don’t go south, even if it is at the cost of myself. I am good friends with a bunch of the members, it is basically my digital home. I have not joined multiple tmc servers as I wanted to prioritise this one rather than splitting myself between multiple ‘families’. I had a whole section in part 3, the finale of my fixed minecraft series dedicated to community, and how great wavetech has been great at that. To see that all be flushed away in haste over a single message which was in response as to why I was questioning the logo change, deeply hurts me on a level I have never felt before.
>
> I understand that I could have worded things better. I was already having a terrible day before hand, I had never felt safe enough to voice my beliefs around this before so didn’t know how to word things properly, for fear of something exactly like this would happen, where what I would say in accordance with my right to free speech, would be taken to the extreme, into areas I don’t agree with, then be ‘punished’ for what I never meant. I never intended for my original question of the logo to have so much response, so seeing the flood of messages in the background led me to rush my answer without thought and how it might affect those around me. Once the dust had settled, I had already privately apologised to those I might have hurt the most and tried to clear up where I was coming from and made sure we were still on good terms with each other. I never tried to attack anyone personally and thus become an enemy and hurt them. I never intended for this to escalate as much as it did, especially never intended for anyone outside of the few I was talking with within the private member chat to read what I said and thus cause drama. I never meant for any of it.

> I am sorry if I hurt you. I am sorry if you feel I said something wrong, homophobic or the like. I am sorry if you feel I had sabotaged and betrayed a friendship and I am sorry if you feel my actions are deserving of me being burnt at the stake. I am sorry for the drama I have caused. I am sorry Earth if you feel like I was making wavetech an ‘unsafe’ place. I am sorry to all who got caught up in this mess. I am especially sorry to those of the LGBT community who feel I might have something against you. I don’t. One of my best irl friends is gay, and that has not been an issue in the slightest between us. All I want to do is follow in Jesus’s footsteps, where he loves everyone, regardless of who they are and what they have done. Who forgives those in need of it, and to be the best versions of ourselves. I made a mistake, I did not hold myself to that high standard at that moment, and I am sorry. I understand that this event will not be forgotten, and that a layer of trust has been torn, but I hope you can forgive me.

##### Dissection

There is quite a bit to this message, so we're going to break it down piece by piece.  
Anything that is not necessarily super relevant will be skipped.

> If I answer yes, then that would imply that I must also support Irreversible cosmetic surgery for children who are still not even aloud to drink or get tattoos, PRIDE parades and pre-school drag shows with their push of sexualised nudity onto minors who are yet to even learn what sex is. That I must be in support of MAPS (Minor attracted people) which is just another name for paedophiles, males entering dedicated female safe spaces like bathrooms and prisons, with nothing more than a wig, Workplace diversity quotas who hire based on who they have sex with, not necessarily their professional skills, and the control of language like calling people ‘birthing person’, which is incredibly offensive to biological women

::: warn
MAP means "Minor Attracted Person". It is a term created by pedophiles as an attempt to make it sound less bad.  
Several times, these people have attempted to position themselves as part of the LGBTQ+ community. They are not, and never have been.

:::

Here, Jab is insinuating that pride is about

- pre-school drag shows with their push of sexualised nudity onto minors who are yet to even learn what sex is
- males entering dedicated female safe spaces like bathrooms and prisons
- Workplace diversity quotas who hire based on who they have sex with
- control of language like calling people ‘birthing person’

It is not. Nobody wants this, and nobody is asking for this.  
First of all, nobody is advocating for pre-school drag shows. This is a false narrative that is being pushed by conservative quacks who are attempting to discredit the pride movement.  
Overall, this is a caricature of what pride is actually about, and is just plain false.

---

> I don’t care what pronouns you use, that’s not me saying I don’t think they are important, that is me saying I will treat you like an equal regardless of what you call yourself

This is all we want.

> which is what the goal of the pride movement started off as, equality.

It has basically become a sort of religion of its own, and it has overstepped its boundaries.

The pride movement is not just a movement about equality. It is also a movement about embracing our sexuality/gender and allowing ourselves to enjoy it.  
It is a movement about having fun being who we are.

---

> I understand that I could have worded things better. I was already having a terrible day before hand

Having a bad day is not justification for transphobia or queerphobia.

---

Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequences for your speech. Free speech means the government will not prohibit you from saying certain things. It does not mean that you won't face social consequences for said speech.

I never meant for any of it.

Based on our communication with several of the members who were there, if you did attempt to apologize, it was not sufficient, and you are no longer on 'good terms' with them.  
Additionally, if you did not want to cause all this fuss, then you shouldn't have said anything. Sometimes it is best to just see something you disagree with but not say anything.

##### Summary

Overall, this is just not a good apology.  
Jab continues to insist that he is righteous for what he said and refuses to admit that he was in the wrong.

#### Second 'Apology'

Although we do not have access to the original message, and believe it to be deleted, we do have a text copy of the messages he sent after the apology.  
Although we can't prove that it did come from jab, we hope that the rest of this document is sufficient proof for you to believe us.

Here is the message:

> Hello wavetech. I’m back. And I hate pride.
>
> I come bearing good news, the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in Jesus and you will be saved.  
> For those of you who don’t know, I used to be a wavetech member, had been for a few years and was actively engaging in the members chat for the last 2, up until last month, when I made a quickly thought out comment in the private members channel stating that I do not agree with logo change for June, and a few short reasons why. Things got a little heated, someone leaked my message to the public chat and left himself, creating unwarranted drama. I have made a small apology privately to those who would have been most hurt by what I said, even though what I said wasn’t targeted at anyone, just at the movement, and before I had a chance to make a larger apology to the rest of the members, my member role was removed despite no prior warnings or situations or anything, absolutely no room for tolerance. So I made an apology to the public chat since the situation had already spread there, only for people to not take it seriously, make fun of it, call me names and bring up my past, which then I left the discord.
>
> If you didn’t want drama, the logo should never have changed in the first place. It’s practically inviting it, and if not me, then someone else. This is a minecraft discord, and if stayed that way without inviting politics into it, the only drama you would get would be minecraft related.
>
> I’m glad that my “naked stunt” was brought up, saves me the shame and embarrassment of first talking about it but now I can better explain what happened, why I did it and how I’ve changed since then.  
> I grew up in a very bubbled environment, Christian family, Christian school, grew up in church and lived in the suburbs of Australia. My first time ever hearing about anything LGBT related was mid high school when stuff around gay marriage laws were passed. I had come across the world of naturism at a young age through my attempt but distaste for porn, but my parents were always quick to put an end to anything related to that. Then I started dating someone with dissociative identity disorder and who would later come out non-binary. She would slowly break down the barriers of my religious upbringing until I eventually did the thing I regret the absolute most in my life, having sex outside of marriage. Eventually we decided to run away to the other side of the world, England, which is also a more liberal country.  
> On the other side of the world, away from my family and friends, away from my hobbies and life, away from God, and now with a relationship going down the drain for several reasons, I turned to the one thing I had been denied my whole life. I joined an online group called British Naturism, which became an echo chamber, hearing other peoples stories, seeing what others were doing, talking about how good it is, being surrounded by a constant shouting “be proud to be a naturist” “fight for naturist rights”, “raise awareness” and “educate the public on the laws”. Although not strictly part of the LGBT/pride community, there was a large overlap as the larger naturist community followed the same sort of mindset. I got to a point where I wanted to “join in on the fun” and decided to go on a walk around the nearby forest, and although most of walk was fine as I didn’t run into anyone, which was my intention, the problem came in the last few minutes on my way to where I was living which was more around other houses and not trees. One of the houses I had to go past I heard kids inside, although did not see any, and by chance a parent came out, saw me, got angry, followed me and called the cops. They came arrested me and took me to a holding cell as they worked out what to do.
>
> Now, I still believe that nudity alone is not a bad thing, especially from a Christian perspective. I’m not going to explain in detail here, just pass you onto this YouTuber (youtube.com/watch?v=5fyTJTQLU_8) as that is not important to what I am trying to say. Sure, what I did wasn’t illegal, hence why I was released without charges, public nudity in England is legal, and you can see this via how London is home to one of the largest annual World Naked Bike Ride events, but what I did do was wrong. Sitting in the cell for a couple of hours really gave me the time to think about my life and how far I had fallen. How lost and alone I was and how everything was falling to pieces. My mental health was at its worst. At rock bottom, the only way is up, and up I did go. I joined a Christian cult temporarily to kick start my faith back into gear, who also helped me get out my toxic relationship because I was not strong enough to get out myself. Then once I had gotten all I could from them, I left England and went back to my family, to my home church and to my life. Since then I have been reading Gods word and praying to him almost everyday, and He has transformed my life in so many ways for the better. I don’t even recognise myself back than to who I am today. My life has been so much more full of happiness, I have never felt better. Christ saved me, and I will fight for Him to the day I die, and then I will be with Him for the rest of eternity.
>
> So am I against pride? Yes. And not because I just “hate gays” or anything, but because I have witnessed first hand the destruction the pride mindset can cause, and from there, I have researched into the lies of the movement. Listening to Jordan Peterson (<youtube.com/watch?v=n5fUW1HuVIQ> ), Misha Petrov (youtube.com/watch?v=hhN3Zhz781w), Think before you sleep (youtube.com/watch?v=Nb8k5gBFfgE), hearing people who are LGBT who disagree with Pride (youtube.com/watch?v=L4QZ_1xCfVk, youtube.com/watch?v=WjKjCqfMrHE, youtube.com/watch?v=Ucl_2QteO9I), looking into the history of the movement like the monster of John Money (youtube.com/watch?v=0Zw1EdRKocI) who came up with gender theory (seriously look him up), heard stories like that of the detransitioner Chloe Cole (youtube.com/watch?v=DSGgR3W_jjg), hearing other Christian perspectives (youtube.com/watch?v=aKfv-AlwEp4, youtube.com/watch?v=N3vRDCzV0tc, youtube.com/watch?v=sKj-zZsogSc) and so, so many others, and I now stand in opposition to everyone that pride stands for, and all the evil that comes with it. But wouldn’t that make me also against the people too? Nonsense. Just because I think drinking is bad for you doesn’t mean I hate people because they drink. And better yet, although many people think that they don’t have a choice and can’t stop drinking, the good news is that it is always a choice, and they can change, they can get better. Everything is a choice we have free will, and if you think there is something that isn’t a choice, then leave it in Gods hands and he can do wonders. He is all powerful and created the entire universe. Anything He says goes, He can move mountains if he deemed it so. You might say “but I was born this way”, but that is why we are called to be born again, of flesh and spirit. You might say “but this is who I am”, and that is why we are called to deny ourselves, pick up our cross and follow Jesus. You might say “but isn’t pride good?”, I say my definition of what is good is based on what our creator has deemed to be good, and He says pride is not good. I ask you, where do you get your definition of what “good” is? Is it just based on feeling? Cause I tell you a society built on feelings and not on truth is doomed for destruction, and pride comes before the fall.  
> I believe that the devil, who is the prince of this world, has spoon fed those in the lgbt community lies, so much so that they feel they have no choice but to believe them, for the devil tells you what you want to hear, even if it isn’t good. The devil tempts everyone, even me, and he tempts everyone differently based on their desires. Some he tempts with pride, some with lust, some with greed, some with gluttony and some with other wrongdoings. The devil wants to destroy that which is good, especially that which is very good, created in the image of God, Gods masterpiece. Why else would people want to go against what they were designed for and have sex with those who are not of the other gender, with those outside of the covenant of marriage, children, animals and to themselves. Why else would people want to cut off perfectly functioning body parts to fit with their own narrative of themselves they have constructed, while at the same time also hypocritically preaching that said body parts don’t define a person. How can you say you want to be a woman, if you can’t even define what a woman is. Why else would people preach that pro-choice is a good thing, when the baby had no choice, and if you aren’t pro life, what are you, pro-death? The devil is why there is so much bad in this world, so much hurt, evil and death. The devil is the only one who I hate, as he is the puppet master, and his punishment will come, but the puppets, they can be set free, they can be loved. Every time a lie is believed or a temptation given into, another strong is attached, and the more strings, the more control the devil has over that person. The puppets themselves ofcourse can’t set themselves free, but they have been given a voice so that at any time they can call upon the one greater than the devil, Jesus, to cut the strings for them.

> — Puberty blockers are NOT reversible, and usually puberty is the cure to their feelings as the large majority of kids who think they were the wrong gender change after puberty, some just turned out to be gay  
> — The suicide rate of “trans individuals” increases a few years after surgery once the initial “I’m finally me” wears off and realise they are still unhappy with who they think they are, and have now done permanent damage to their body  
> — There are only 2 sexes, sure intersex exists but it’s such a small outlier, and it’s usually obvious which shouldn’t be there, the sexual organs are the only part of the body than don’t function alone but need it’s other half, doing anything outside of that is like taking 2 (or more) puzzle pieces and trying to force them together in a way that wasn’t designed  
> — There is no such thing as gender, only your sex (male or female) and your personality (your desires, preferences, mannerisms…). Sure some things are more “masculine” and some more “feminine”, but just because you do some things which don’t fit the so called “gender norm” doesn’t make you not who you are  
> — “We are letting children find their truth”. Wrong. This whole thing is a social contagion being forced onto children. In this attention deficit world we live as everyone and their parents interacts with the world through social media, people, especially kids, will do whatever it takes to get attention, so when they are told that “being part of the LGBT community will make them ‘special’”, despite the fact their brains have not developed enough to properly understand what it is they are talking about, they will jump at that chance, and as they get rewarded with attention for being “brave” for “coming out” they will delve deeper into this fantasy they have created. And as the attention they get for “being gay” diminishes they feel like they have to turn to something bigger and greater and “come out as trans” and repeat. Also, for the love of God, can you KEEP THE CHILDREN OUT OF THIS.
>
> If you saw a young child playing with a sharp knife as if it were any other toy for they do not know the danger; which is more loving? To let them play with it in which they could get hurt, or to take away the knife away, no matter how much they cry because they wanted to play with knife? Pride is that knife, and not only would I take the knife away, I would also try to get that child back to its mother, it’s creator, the one who knows what is best for the child. I would try to bring them back to God the creator of the universe and everyone in it, who is perfect, good and just, worthy of all praise. God already loves you, and He wants you to love Him back.
>
> Despite all this, you may still call me a homophobe, transphobe or whatever-other-phobe, but those are just words, words used way to much that they have lost their meaning, and if being one of them means being against the abomination that is gay sex or the absolute insult that is “gender affirming care”, then it is a label I will wear proudly. You may want to call me intolerant, hateful, a bigot, but may I ask who was the one who actually shunned someone else for plainly speaking their opinion, who was the one that called names, brought up the past and yelled “burn them at the stake” for saying something they didn’t like, who was the one who kicked somebody out of the group for being ‘different’? You may want react with the clown emoji or to resort to pointing out grammatical errors as some did last time, I say please do, because by doing so you acknowledge that my argument is sound, yet through your unyielding want to disagree with me you turn to stupid insults in a weak attempt to do any damage to me. You may want to kick me from this discord, but all that will do is prove me right, and it’s not like I will be loosing anything of real worth anyway, for my treasure is not of this world. You may also want to call me a “religious zealot”, and if that is what you think I am for following God, then I would rather be called a zealot and inherit into eternal life in paradise, than to deny my Lord, stay silent and be thrown into eternal damnation along side everyone else who did not follow the narrow path. I am not here to seek your love, but because I love you. I am not here to fight for my redemption but for your salvation. I pray that Jesus might open your eyes so that you may see the truth and not be afraid of it, and that you may repent, seek Him and find rest for your souls.

This part of the message is insinuating that simply changing the logo of a minecraft server is "inviting drama", which, just, no. Further, it attempts to frame this entire thing as "politics", which it absolutely is not.

In this part, Jab here is admitting to public nudity, specifically in front of a minor. This then got him arrested.  
This is not the type of person we wish to have leading our minecraft community.

I had come across the world of naturism at a young age through my attempt but distaste for porn, but my parents were always quick to put an end to anything related to that.

Growing up in an environment without any LGBTQ+ representation is not that uncommon. It is completely okay to be ignorant about something, we hold no judgement against any who are.

---

Here, Jab is openly admitting to joining a (in his words) christian 'cult'.  
Typically, a 'cult' is not a *good* thing, nor a thing one should *want* to join.

Jab's response upon being questioned about the ban in the Fixed Minecraft server:

> In short, 1. It’s was a discord server about technical minecraft, not gender/sexual identity, and I wanted to keep it that way. And 2. Have you seen any pride parades and other stuff the overall movement represents? I feel like the movement has overstepped its boundaries and is now causing more harm than good, especially with regard to children, and I didn’t want the minecraft server that I played on to associate itself with that. I guess you could say I’m an ally of the people, not the movement. Anyway. Back to minecraft

### Fixed Minecraft Discord Server

There have been persistent issues of transphobia and queerphobia in the Fixed Minecraft discord server, and Jab refuses to moderate it appropriately, instead allowing it to continue with no impediment.

Additionally, he will contribute, although loosely, to the transphobia/queerphobia himself.

Although the following list of messages is not comprehensive, it should be representative.

Honza is a member of the discord server who was repeatedly spreading LGBTQ+ hate and creating pointless 'debates' regarding those topics.

> someone can have homosexual temptations without giving into them

In DMs, he was questioned regarding his stance on LGBTQ+ issues:

> From a biblical perspective:  
> I believe in God. I believe this God created everything, the universe, the earth and us. I believe He loves us and wants what's best for us. I believe He is good, and I believe He is just. Being our creator, He knows us. Both personally and as a part of humanity. He knows what is good for us and what is not good for us. He created us last, we are His masterpiece, created in His own image. When we first created us, after calling all of creation good, he called us very good. However this is when the devil started to play. Wanting to take God's place, he hated all that God called good, and us being very good he hates the most. Being created in God's own image, which means with spirit, since God is spirit, we have the ability to choose our own path, and we chose to follow the devil, who tempted us with things that we wanted, even though God told us not to, creating sin. No longer choosing God, we were thrown out of the presence of God as the world became hostile towards us.  
> Through prophets God gave us His Law, a list of rules we ought to follow. These rules coming from God means that these are good rules, however no one could follow all of them, and thus we were all rule breakers. Eventually Jesus, God's own Son came, lived in accordance with all the rules and then sacrificed Himself in our place so that we do not have to face the punishment that comes with being a rule breaker. He then rose from the dead proving that He has power not over sin but also death, and that those who choose to follow Him will not only have their sins cleansed, but be raised from the dead to be with Him.  
> It is said that when God made us, He made us male and female. And that for this reason, a man will leave his father and mother to be united with their wife and in doing so become one flesh (that is, to have children). That is how God designed us, and that is therefore what is good for us. In the list of laws God gave us which are good laws, there are some which talk about how homosexuality is detestable to God (He even wiped out 2 cities due to their homosexual tendencies), and even for males to wear female clothing and vice versa. He designed males and females to be different and have separate roles, to be the 2 different sides to the same coin, and trying to mix that goes against God's design. He calls pride a sin, and says many other things which will be too long to go over everything.  
> Although the bible does not say much about some things in particular like trans since these weren't issues back then but we can extrapolate the wisdom of the laws we have an apply them to current day things, and for example being trans looks that person is rejecting what God gave them to the point where they cut off functioning body parts in the name of identity, and usually to the point where childbirth would no longer be an option. Even though the law can not save us, it is still a good thing to try to follow. And since it is only through Jesus can we be saved, He said "those who love me will do what I say" (i.e. attempt to follow the law). Does that mean God hates gay people? No. He loves the people, but hates the act. The problem arises when those people then take that act, and make it their identity, to the point where you can't even criticise the act with them taking it personally. Much like I can love someone even if they have stolen something from me, but that love for them will make me tell them to not steal again and to ask for forgiveness for the time they did. However if they make their identity about being a thief, then they would not be able to see that I am trying to help them, but they will feel that I am against them personally. As I don't identify with things of this earth, but find my identity in Christ, people can attack my wrongdoings without me taking it personally.  
> The devil tempts us all, and God knows that. The devil makes us think that good things are bad, and that bad things are good. The devil tricks us by appearing to be truthful, but is deceptively sitting in lies. Also being spiritual, the devil can not physically be seen or heard, (some say the greatest trick the devil ever did was make us believe he didn't exist), but he impacts our thoughts and desires and turns us away from God and all the good that comes from him. He lets the devil roam the world now, as He is mercifully giving us time to turn to Him, but a time will come when He says enough is enough, He will destroy the devil, and then judge us.  
> Sometimes you might think I am saying something that could be taken as 'homophobic' or similar, but that is not the case. I am not judging you nor am I against you. If God loves you, who am I to not also love you (one of my best friends is someone who struggles with homosexual temptations), and if God is going to judge, why should I? I am only speaking like some person on reddit giving law advice as a warning for the judge that is yet to come, telling you to get Jesus as your Lawyer so that you might not be found guilty. If I were to be the things I am called by the world, I would be kicking people out of the discord on account of their pronouns, disregarding what they say and treating them as anything less than they are, beings created by and in the image of God. Some may try to say "but God made me this way, he must have made a mistake", no, sin made you this way, and that is why we are called to be born again, of spirit, not of flesh.  
> So although God may call a homosexual act sin, so is every other sexual act that is not between 1 male and 1 female within the confines of marriage. And pretending to be the opposite gender is a sin, but so is anything else that goes against God's design, it's just this is one the people of this age are currently focusing on. Someone can have sexual temptations much like one can have the temptation to steal, but we need to resist those temptations, and resist the devil. Trust in the Lord and rely on him for salvation. God loves you to receive you as you are, but He loves you too much to leave you as you are. Much like a parent will enforce restrictions on their child for the child's benefit, even if the child does not like it at the time, it is because of the parents love for their child that they want their child to be better, even if it means pain now.  
> In short I am not against queer people, just the acts. Who am I as a mere human to judge over another human. No, I am just here to warn before the future judgement from the just God above to come. Some may not like the yelling, but I see the train, and I am yelling for you to get off the track. You may like the track, but staying on it will only bring destruction. It is not an act of hate, but an act of love, even if not self evident at first.
>
> From a worldly perspective:  
> Have you done any critical thinking on this topic? Like actually making sure to step out of your echo chamber, look at both sides of the arguments objectively and come to your own decision? Have you looked into the science, have you witnessed the corruption of the media, the absolute brainwashing effect of tiktok? The hypocrisy of the left and the complete disaster of the western world we live in today? Many people can't even define the word 'woman' anymore without breaking the first rule of definitions: you can't include the word you are defining.  
> Naturally, we are born when a male and female have sex, so by the natural order, 2 males, 2 females or anything else goes against that. We in our very DNA are defined to be one or the other XX or XY. I hear the argument of some don't, yes that is true, but it is a fraction of a fraction, is a genetic deformity, like when someone has 11 fingers rather than 10, and their official titles XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) and XYY (Jacobs syndrome) are recognised as a male with an extra chromosome.  
> Tell me, which can change, a thought, or a thing? If people truly believe that their body does not match up with the idea of whom they are, does it not make far more logical sense that it is the brain, which is far more malleable, deceptive and less understood be in the wrong, the one that changed, and the one that needs to set things in order? The brain can be altered by many things, both internal and external, and what affects one part of the brain affects many other parts. Is it not obvious, that as more and more people are saying they are unhappy and mentally unwell, we are getting more and more people who come out and start doing things that for the vast majority of history have been considered signs of negative mental health? There is a reason why stereotypes of exist, because nothing is in isolation, and generally the ones that mutilate themselves in a minor way (dying hair, smoking/vape, drugs/alcohol), are more likely to start mutilating themselves in a major way (tattoos, plastic surgery) and then those are more likely to go on to mutilate themselves completely (cutting off healthy body parts in the name of gender, disability or something else), as those are the ones that are the most internally depressed (hate the world, hate the people, say they are fine but are fragile, as anything that goes against their own narrative they burst out uncontrollably, then blame others for violating their "safe space"), lonely (always wanting to seek attention, need to be chronically online to not face the fact they have so few irl friends) and dangerous (kill unborn babies, seek to tear down establishments, damage property, ruin others reputations and so.. so much more)? I am not saying everyone is like this, but you can't ignore the data.  
> The 2 biggest reasons why this is so prevalent today is, The Sexual Revolution and the age of social media. Where it became normalised for people to talk about sex and stuff outside a marriage, and then which lead to people trying to 'discover' themselves, which lead to more people losing themselves, and filling that hole with an empty happiness to cope with what they have lost. Add in social media and have the whole world at your fingertips, with information travelling so fast, it is nigh impossible to fact check everything and be sure of the claims you hear. When an algorithm learns your likes, suddenly that's all you ever see, and very quickly you fall into a world unrecognisable to what you knew. I would know, I've fallen to the traps before on other topics with similar methods and hidden dangers. Parents no longer parent their own children, and teach them what they believe to be good morals, the internet does that now, but the internet has no care for you. It will tell you what you want to hear, not what you need to hear. It's easy to block out what you don't want to hear and follow the smooth sound of "I agree".  
> Then, children. Oh how I mourn for the children of this age. This is the worst part. Let kids be kids. If it is illegal for people to get tattoos until the age of 16, which you could argue is just a little artwork on your skin, why is it legal for kids to be put on damaging and irreversible puberty blockers and cut off body parts for the sake of what they feel. A kid is young and doesn't know the world, they don't understand, that's why parents take charge of the most important areas of a child's life.  
> What else do you expect to happen when you tell a kid who is lost to 'find themself', to a kid who is lonely that they can find community in this, to a kid who is neglected that they can be 'special' if they just did this and that it is 'brave' to do, even if they don't believe it at first, the mind adapts, add social media and its a lost cause. They believe they can just 'change' gender because they aren't told the details, they aren't told that the are mental differences between men and women, the aren't told their are physical differences, they aren't told that the 'genitals' they would be receiving are nothing but a fake that they will need to actively prevent their own body from rejecting for the rest of their life. Kids are susceptible, and people know this, which is why the pride specifically targets children, from 'family friendly', 'drag story time', having bright colours and everything else. It's disgusting. Have you heard the stories of detransitioners like Chloe Cole today and the horrors they have been through? I hear the argument "Would you rather an alive boy or a dead girl", statistics show that the suicide rate actually increases post surgery if you give it a few years for the initial happiness to wear away. 9 times out of 10, just going through puberty naturally is the cure that shapes your mind to agree with what your body is, and it is common for people who thought they might be trans to end up only being gay, or that they were only a tomboy when they were young but became feminine when they were older.  
> I've heard the argument that since people in the past were homosexual, that means it's valid for people to be so today. That's a dumb argument. We had wars in the past, does that make war okay? Heck, people used to sacrifice their own babies into fire to appease their own 'gods', does that make it okay today? I guess though it's still quite similar to the late term abortions we have today, look that up, I dare you. Besides, even throughout most of history these acts were condemned. If you really want to know your history, check out the monster behind gender theory as it is known today: John Money.
>
> Then there is the personal side:  
> My ex-fiancee is perhaps the most toxic person I have ever met, trauma upon trauma, split identity disorder, BPD, non-binary and so much more. My life was a mess back then, and I'm glad I am out of that situation now. Attempting to lecture me on this and that, saying the worst things and yet believing they were doing good. And then when something did go wrong it was always somehow my fault.  
> People who align themselves with the pride movement call themselves tolerant, yet will be the first to be intolerant to anyone who doesn't fully agree to their beliefs. I was kicked out of the wavetech technical minecraft server because I expressed disagreement with the rainbow logo change for June. I had been there for years, no prior incidents, then boom, out within 24 hours. They call themselves diverse, yet as a straight white male, I fall under the most hated group of people by this community before I even speak a word out of my mouth. All it takes is a few words before others take what I say out of context, start putting their own words into my mouth and make me look hateful and against them, which is never the case.  
> It's forced down my throat all the time. You can barely go on a walk anymore without seeing a flag, go to the movies without having some 'representing' that really didn't need to be there. Whatever happened to 'what happens in the bedroom stays in the bedroom', when did what gender you think yourself to be become the most important thing there is. Heck I can't even go onto my own discord without fear that there will be yet again another conversation about this topic which I don't want to engage with.
>
> The mind that helped me look into minecraft and see all its flaws, is the same mind that has looked into this and see that this is far worse in every possible way. Give it a few decades until people stop being woke and actually wake up, and people will look at the pride flags of today with even more disgust than the nazi flag for all the horrors that came out of this age. Not because I consider queer people like the nazis, but because the movement itself, which is lead by the devil himself, has brainwashed and blinded people until they believe that right is wrong, good is bad, male is female, oppression is justice, trauma is joy, feelings is truth, love is hate and that God is dead. I could go on for far longer, bring up more points, explain these points in more detail. I could point you to others like jordan peterson, misha petrov and many others, I could point you to queer people who dislike the larger pride community like Amir Odom, Finding Sky and Blaire White. I just hope this is enough to roughly get my views across, to show that I am not unor mis-informed, and it's not some 'internalised homophobia' but a conclusion I have come to because of the faith I believe in, through logic and science and through the personal experiences I have had.

I am gong to avoid deconstructing this entire message, however there are two points I want to address:

> People who align themselves with the pride movement call themselves tolerant, yet will be the first to be intolerant to anyone who doesn't fully agree to their beliefs.

The attempt to frame queer people and the queer movement in general as [ontologically](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/ontologically) evil is an attempt at [demonizing the enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonizing_the_enemy), a common diversion tactic and moral fallacy.

## General Difficulty to Work with

Above and beyond the transphobia and queerphobia, Jab is just generally difficult to work with. He is combative and not open to suggestions, and will post long diatribes on his opinion, as well as not particularly being open to suggestions from others.  
His ego gets in the way too much in the project.

This is difficult to show examples of, as it is primarily based off of the feeling contributors have across many different days rather than one specific message.

## Going Forward

Due to all of these issues, we will be forking Fixed Minecraft and creating our own project based off of it.
