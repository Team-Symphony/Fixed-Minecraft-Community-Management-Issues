# Jab and Issues with the Management of Fixed Minecraft
## Read the full doc on this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/Team-Symphony/Fixed-Minecraft-Community-Management-Issues/wiki)!

For several reasons, primarily related to green_jab's actions and opinions, many members of staff and contributors to the project have decided to leave Fixed Minecraft and fork it, creating our own project. A list of members who are participating in this fork is provided below.

As a community, we aim to be as inclusive as we can, and sometimes this requires excluding some people who are not being welcoming to others. Many of the people in this community are themselves trans or queer, and we will not tolerate any hate towards those who are.

The future home of the forked project is located at [Team Symphony](https://github.com/Team-Symphony) on GitHub.  
The Discord server for the project can also be joined here: [https://dsc.gg/symphony-mc](https://dsc.gg/symphony-mc) or [https://discord.gg/hTTPbbnRGG](https://discord.gg/hTTPbbnRGG)

> [!NOTE]
> We **DO NOT** have any issue with those who are religious or hold religious beliefs. It only becomes an issue when you attempt to force said religious beliefs onto everyone else and use the religious beliefs to justify hate.

> [!WARNING]
> Do **NOT** harass anyone over this. This document is only intended to inform, not to stir up hate. Harassment isn't beneficial and won't go anywhere.
